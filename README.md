- 👋 Hi, I’m Harvin Johal
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to keep on top of my knowledge on the Spring Boot Java framework as well as look to explore new programming languages such as Python and PHP - follow my journey where I will give constant updates with my commits on what I am working on during the weeks ahead.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find a job within the programming languages discussed but as you will find is I am very open to trying new languages and going out of my comfort zone.
